📌 Overview
The Student Performance and Analysis System is a comprehensive, data-driven project designed to analyze, predict, and understand student academic performance using various factors such as demographics, study habits, attendance, stress levels, and extracurricular participation. Leveraging the power of machine learning and data visualization, the system provides actionable insights to enhance student outcomes and institutional performance.

🎯 Objectives
Identify patterns and correlations in student behavior and performance.

Predict academic results using various machine learning models.

Provide clear visual insights into the factors that impact academic success.

Help institutions identify at-risk students and make data-informed decisions.

🚀 Key Features
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Understand trends and relationships between student attributes and academic outcomes using statistical graphs and summary statistics.

🤖 Predictive Modeling:
Apply regression, classification, and clustering algorithms to forecast student performance.

📈 Academic Insights:
Visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) like attendance, study hours, stress levels, etc., and their influence on academic scores.

📚 Student Evaluation:
Classify and evaluate students based on performance metrics and behavioral patterns.
