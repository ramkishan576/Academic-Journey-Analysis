Student Performance and Analysis System

Description

The Student Performance and Analysis System is a data-driven project aimed at analyzing and predicting student academic performance based on multiple factors such as attendance, study habits, demographics, and extracurricular activities. By using machine learning models, this system aims to uncover patterns that help improve student outcomes and success.

This project leverages a dataset with various student attributes, and through data analysis, visualizations, and predictive modeling, it provides insights into student performance and factors affecting their academic success.

Features

Data Analysis & Visualization: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand trends and correlations within student performance data.
Predictive Modeling: Build machine learning models to predict studentsâ€™ grades based on multiple factors like study hours, attendance, extracurricular activities, and family background.
Academic Insights: Generate visualizations and reports to understand key drivers of student performance and academic success.
Performance Evaluation: Assess and classify students based on their academic results and behaviors.
Technologies Used

Python
Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
NumPy for numerical computations
Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
Jupyter Notebooks for project analysis and exploration
Machine Learning: Regression Models, Classification Models, and Clustering Techniques
Dataset Overview

This dataset includes the following features:

Demographic Information: Age, Gender, Department
Academic Scores: Midterm, Final, Projects, and Total Score
Behavioral Data: Study Hours, Attendance Percentage, Extracurricular Activities
Environmental Data: Internet Access at Home, Family Income, Parent Education Level
Stress Level: 1-10 scale based on student stress
Sleep Hours: Hours of sleep per night
Use Cases

At-Risk Student Identification: Predict and identify students who may be struggling and require additional support.
Academic Performance Insights: Gain insights into factors affecting student success, such as the impact of study hours, attendance, and extracurricular involvement.
